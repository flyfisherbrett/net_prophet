## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is just a superset of JavaScript, so don't be afraid!

You have several options for working with TypeScript. Most common editors will allow you to install a TypeScript extension. This is important as you want to take advantage of the compile-time advantages you get with a typed language.

I really enjoy using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because of it's tight Typescript integration (it was actually built with TypeScript), but again, your favorite editor probably has an extension to take advantage of what TypeScript provides.

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15.

Don't forget to run npm install once you've pulled down the repo.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can also run `ng serve` with the `-prod` flag, but right now the development and production builds both point to the actual CXO Api when making requests for data. You can change this in `environments/environment.ts`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

Scaffolding is not required. Feel free to just add files manually as you need them.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
